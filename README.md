## Style Guide :nail_care:

<a name="style--wordpress"></a><a name="2.2"></a>

- [2.1](#style--wordpress) **Wordpress**

  <a name="wordpress--framework"></a><a name="2.1.1"></a>

  - [2.1.1](#wordpress--framework) **Framework**

    - A modern Wordpress framework written by Matt Billings is used to allow for modern JS & CSS features to be utilized. The framework is available [here](https://github.com/mbillz/wordpress-starter).

  <a name="wordpress--structure"></a><a name="2.1.2"></a>

  - [2.1.2](#wordpress--structure) **Structure**

    - Theme development takes place in `/src`. JavaScript is written in `/src/js/` and CSS is written in `/src/css`. The Wordpress theme is developed in `/src/theme/`.

    - Custom page templates are placed in `/src/theme/page-templates`.

    - Single post type templates, archives, and category pages are placed in the root of theme in `/src/theme`.

    - Reusable modules that multiple templates throughout the theme call are placed in `/src/theme/inc` and called by the `get_template_part()` function as documented [in the Wordpress codex](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_template_part/).

    - Images used by the theme are placed in `/src/theme/img`.

    - When necessary, any vendor CSS or JS files are placed in `/src/theme/vendor` (as further described below).

  <a name="wordpress--css"></a><a name="2.1.3"></a>

  - [2.1.3](#wordpress--css) **CSS**

    - CSS is organized and written in a modular structure. All files are imported into `/src/css/index.css`. Organize files by feature or page. A reset.css is included in the repository.

    - [BEM](http://getbem.com/)

      - All CSS is written using BEM to maximize collaboration. BEMâ€Šor Block Element Modifier is a methodology that helps you to create reusable components and code sharing in front-end development

      - [Getting Started Guide](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/)

    - If making any fundamental changes to previously written code, please ensure that the modifications won't break anything else on the site.

    - Third party CSS will be installed by npm and imported in `index.css`. If the package isn't available by npm, place the css file in a `/src/theme/vendor` and enqueue the CSS file in `/src/theme/functions.php`. Use conditional statements to only enqueue external files when needed.

  <a name="wordpress--js"></a><a name="2.1.4"></a>

  - [2.1.4](#wordpress--js) **JavaScript**

    - JS is organized and written in a modular structure. All files are imported into `/src/js/index.js`. Organized files by feature.

    - When possible, write in plain JavaScript without jQuery. jQuery brings unecessary file size into a website. Modern JavaScript has brought many features from jQuery into use.

      - [PlainJS](https://plainjs.com/javascript/) is a helpful tool for functions and strategies that replace jQuery methods.

    - At times, clients require outside libraries that have jQuery as a dependancy so it will need to be included. In this case, enqueue it properly in `/src/theme/functions.php` as described [here](https://digwp.com/2009/06/including-jquery-in-wordpress-the-right-way/).

    - Third party JS libraries will be installed with npm and import in the relevant JS file. If the package isn't available by npm, place the css file in a `/src/theme/vendor` and enqueue the CSS file in `/src/theme/functions.php`. Use conditional statements to only enqueue external files when needed.

  <a name="wordpress--fonts"></a><a name="2.1.5"></a>

  - [2.1.5](#wordpress--fonts) **Fonts**

    - Custom fonts are placed in `/src/fonts`.

    - Only .woff and .woff2 are necessary in modern browsers.
